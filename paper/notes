Weight Decay - 
Objective Function - Measure of the "goodness of a fit" and is the value of the fitting criteria and weight decay

	6-6-1
	49 - weights
	Objective function - 1207418352
	Error within +- -10
	error function has strange curve to it 
2)	Random Order
	

We have to make a design decision, if we train and test on one geographic location, our model is going to be inherently over fit and a non-general solution. But That 
Seems to better fit the use case of real-estate data as the data is incredible geographic dependent. 

We are working with very limited dataset, going to try all of new york 

Dating cleaning - removing some NA values for certain year + month combos

There seems to be time dependency on error, its hard to tell with limited data set. this dependency also occurs in state data, going to test for larger and larger sets

How do i normalize this? scale function caused very small objective function value but prediction was way off 

After looking at PCA inventory measure and ratio foreclosure accounted for a huge amount of variance

The model seems to be predicting the same value for all input -> This was caused by a technical issue of not passing in the target variable as a dataframe.... it didn't seem to change the results

I forgot to normalize! Assumed R would do it for me, can't rely on the tools too much

Markov system for time dependence?
